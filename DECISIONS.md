# DECISIONS.md

Architectural decisions. Append-only. Never edit a prior entry; supersede it with a new one.

## D-001: Rebuild rather than refactor v1

**Context:** v1 was a Vite + React SPA on Supabase. Functionally working but with structural issues: SPA blocks SEO; role state cached inconsistently across localStorage and React; schema drift; Pro reveal flow re-broken multiple times.

**Decision:** Greenfield v2 rebuild on Next.js + fresh Supabase project. Keep brand (teal #2D9D9F), domain understanding, lessons. Discard v1 implementation.

**Why:** No deadline pressure. SPA architecture incompatible with SEO-led growth. Schema drift indicated cleanup cost approached rebuild cost.

## D-002: Framework — Next.js 14 App Router

**Decision:** Next.js 14 with App Router.

**Why:** Officially supported by `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` (Next.js 15 has caveats; Next.js 16 unsupported). SSR fixes the SEO problem from v1. App Router is the current Next.js direction.

## D-003: Backend — fresh Supabase project

**Decision:** Fresh Supabase project. Migrations designed from scratch.

**Why:** v1's schema has known drift (phantom columns, half-applied migrations, weird names). Reusing it imports the mess.

## D-004: Role model — Model B

**Decision:** Every user starts as buyer. "Seller" is a superset of "buyer," reachable via an upgrade flow.

**Why:** Matches Nigerian market reality. Asymmetric verification requirements. Most users will never sell. Sellers continue to buy from other sellers.

## D-005: Role canonical column — `user_type`

**Decision:** v2 uses `profiles.user_type` as the canonical user kind. `profiles.role` is reserved for admin elevation only (NULL for non-admins, 'admin' for admins).

**Why:** Single source of truth. Eliminates the v1 dual-column bug class.

## D-006: No localStorage role hints

**Decision:** v2 reads role from the server on every request. Client receives role as a Server Component prop.

**Why:** Performance cost is minimal. Bug surface is zero. v1's `smp:role_hint` caused weeks of bugs.

## D-007: Verification status on `businesses`, not `profiles`

**Decision:** `businesses.verification_status` is canonical.

**Why:** Domain match (verification is of a business). Avoids the v1 phantom-column bug.

## D-008: Naira-only

**Decision:** All prices in NGN. No multi-currency abstraction.

## D-009: WhatsApp number format

**Decision:** Phone numbers stored as E.164 without the `+` (e.g. `2348012345678`). WhatsApp `wa.me/` URLs need exactly this format.

## D-010: Cloudflare Pages, not Vercel

**Decision:** Deploy to Cloudflare Pages.

**Why:** Owner is already on Cloudflare; cost predictable; edge network has Nigerian presence.

## D-011: Node 20 LTS, pnpm 9.x

**Decision:** Pin Node to `>=20.0.0 <21.0.0` and pnpm to `>=9.0.0 <10.0.0`. Use `"packageManager": "pnpm@9.15.9"` in package.json. `.nvmrc` pinned to 20.

**Why:** Cloudflare Pages' build runtime is Node 20.

## D-014: Cloudflare Pages, not Workers

**Decision:** Deploy via `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` to Cloudflare Pages (`*.pages.dev`), not via `@opennextjs/cloudflare` to Workers (`*.workers.dev`).

**Why:** An earlier kickoff attempt switched to Workers + OpenNext on Cloudflare's stated recommendation. That path produced cascading failures specific to Windows + Node tooling + pnpm + OpenNext bundling. The Pages path is familiar to the owner, has a Git-connected auto-deploy via dashboard (no CLI deploy step), and is well-documented. Cloudflare has signaled Pages is deprecated for Next.js, but the deprecation is directional, not immediate. We accept this trade and revisit if/when the deprecation timeline becomes urgent.

**Numbering note:** D-012 and D-013 were used in the earlier (reverted) Workers attempt. They are intentionally skipped here to preserve the lesson that those decisions were considered and reversed.

## D-015: Pin @cloudflare/next-on-pages to 1.13.15 (not 1.13.16)

**Context:** After kickoff, two peer-dependency warnings surfaced:
- `unmet peer next@">=14.3.0 && <=15.5.2": found 14.2.35`
- `unmet peer vercel@">=30.0.0 && <=47.0.4": found 54.0.0`

The first one is unsatisfiable on Next.js 14: **Next.js 14.2.35 is the highest 14.x version ever published.** After 14.2.35, the Next.js team jumped straight to 15.0.0. There is no 14.3.x, no 14.4.x. The `next >=14.3.0` peer declared by `@cloudflare/next-on-pages@1.13.16` is almost certainly an upstream typo (possibly meant `>=15.3.0`).

`@cloudflare/next-on-pages@1.13.15` (the prior patch) declares no `next` peer at all and no upper bound on `vercel`. Adapter behavior between 1.13.15 and 1.13.16 is a patch-level change — no functional difference for our use case.

**Decision:** Pin `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` to `1.13.15`. Keep `next@14.2.35` (the security-patched current 14.x; see Next.js Security Update 2025-12-11). Keep `vercel@^54`. D-002 (Next.js 14) stands unchanged.

**Why:** Cheapest, lowest-risk fix that restores the no-peer-warnings invariant the planner wanted. Downgrading one patch level of the adapter beats either (a) bumping to Next 15 (reverses D-002 for an unrelated typo) or (b) leaving warnings in place (defeats the point of this fix).

**Revisit when:** Cloudflare publishes `@cloudflare/next-on-pages@1.13.17+` with a corrected peer range, OR if the adapter is fully deprecated and we need to evaluate alternatives.

## D-017: Column freezes via triggers, not RLS WITH CHECK

**Context:** Initial RLS policies attempted to freeze `profiles.role` and `businesses.verification_status` using `WITH CHECK (... IS NOT DISTINCT FROM (SELECT ... WHERE id = profiles.id))`. This pattern doesn't work — the subquery resolves against the new row in `WITH CHECK`, comparing the new value to itself.

**Decision:** Column freezes implemented via `BEFORE UPDATE` triggers with `OLD`/`NEW` comparison. RLS enforces row-level ownership; triggers enforce column-level admin-only writes. Triggers run as `SECURITY DEFINER` and check `auth.uid()` against an admin lookup.

**Why:** PostgreSQL RLS policies don't have access to `OLD` row values — only the new row in `WITH CHECK` and the current row in `USING`. Triggers are the textbook PostgreSQL pattern for "only certain roles can change column X."

**Pattern applies to:** `profiles.role`, `businesses.verification_status`. Future column freezes follow the same pattern.

## D-016: Drizzle for schema/types, Supabase client for runtime queries + auth

**Decision:** Drizzle ORM defines schema (`src/db/schema/*.ts`) and generates migrations (`supabase/migrations/*.sql`) and TypeScript types. `@supabase/ssr` handles auth and provides server/client Supabase clients used for runtime queries from Server Components and Server Actions. A separate Drizzle pooled client (`src/lib/db.ts`) exists for typed query patterns that benefit from Drizzle's API.

**Why:** Each tool used for what it's best at. Drizzle's migration tooling and types are excellent. Supabase's auth integration with Next.js App Router via `@supabase/ssr` is purpose-built and mature. Mixing them avoids fighting either.

**Constraints baked in:**
- Drizzle reads `DATABASE_URL` for migrations
- Drizzle pooled client reads `DATABASE_URL_POOLED` at runtime with `prepare: false`
- Supabase clients read `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` for normal auth flows
- Service role client uses `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` for admin tasks only

## D-018: Session Pooler for migrations, Transaction Pooler for runtime (IPv4-compat correction to D-016)

**Context:** D-016 specified `DATABASE_URL` as the Supabase Direct Connection (port 5432, `db.<ref>.supabase.co`) and `DATABASE_URL_POOLED` as the Transaction Pooler (port 6543). On execution this failed: Direct Connection is IPv6-only by default, and the owner's development network is IPv4-only (typical Nigerian residential ISP). The seed script hit `ENOTFOUND` on the direct hostname.

**Decision:** Both DATABASE_URL variables now point at Supabase's connection pooler hostname (`aws-0-eu-west-2.pooler.supabase.com`):
- `DATABASE_URL` → Session Pooler, port 5432 — used for migrations, seed scripts, and any local-dev DDL. Supports prepared statements and DDL.
- `DATABASE_URL_POOLED` → Transaction Pooler, port 6543 — used for runtime queries via `postgres-js` with `prepare: false`. The constraint that prepared statements don't work in transaction mode is unchanged.

**Why:** Avoids the IPv6-only Direct Connection. Both options work from IPv4-only networks. Session Pooler supports the operations migrations need (DDL, advisory locks, prepared statements). Transaction Pooler remains the right choice for stateless serverless/edge runtime where per-statement connection acquisition matches Cloudflare's request lifecycle.

**Alternative considered and rejected:** Enabling Supabase's "IPv4 add-on" ($4/month). Cost is non-trivial relative to the free tier and the pooler-only approach is fully sufficient.

## D-019: Drizzle pooled client is Node-only; runtime queries on Cloudflare Pages use Supabase JS client

**Context:** Phase A initially specced `src/lib/db.ts` (Drizzle + postgres-js) as the runtime client for Server Component queries on Cloudflare Pages. Section 6 caught the conflict at build gate: `postgres-js` requires Node built-ins (`net`, `dns`, `tls`, `stream`) that the V8 isolate environment of Cloudflare Pages Functions does not provide. Build fails with `Module not found: Can't resolve 'net'` as soon as any `runtime = "edge"` route imports the Drizzle client.

The build gate did not catch this in Section 5 because webpack tree-shook the unused import — `src/lib/db.ts` existed but no route imported it, so the Edge-incompatible code never entered the bundle graph.

**Decision:** Runtime split:
- **Edge runtime** (Server Components, Server Actions, route handlers running on Cloudflare Pages Functions): use Supabase JS clients from `src/lib/supabase/{server,client,admin}.ts`. They use `fetch()` against PostgREST/GoTrue and run anywhere JavaScript runs.
- **Node runtime** (scripts, seed, Drizzle Kit migrations, anything running on the owner's local machine or a Node CI box): use the Drizzle pooled client from `src/lib/db.ts`.

Both clients connect to the same database. RLS applies to both. Choosing one over the other is a matter of where the code runs, not what query it performs.

**Why:** Honors the actual capabilities of each runtime. Avoids architectural impossibilities (no fetch-based Postgres driver exists for Supabase). Matches what ARCHITECTURE.md said at kickoff and what Phase A would have produced if I'd internalized it correctly.

**Operational consequence:** Drizzle's nicer typed-query API is unavailable in edge code. Supabase's TypeScript types (generated by `supabase gen types typescript`) provide the typing for `.from(...)` calls in edge code. The trade-off is one ergonomic API call site, not a structural problem.

## D-020: Design language — clean trust-forward (Option 1 / "Stripe-adjacent")

**Context:** After Phase A delivered a working but unstyled foundation, Phase A.5 required a design direction. Options reviewed: (1) clean/structured/trust-forward, (2) marketplace-classic Jiji-style, (3) editorial/boutique, (4) mobile-first native-app style.

**Decision:** Option 1 — clean, structured, trust-forward. Implementation details:
- Brand teal `#2D9D9F` reserved for logo accent, primary CTAs, key highlights, focus states
- Ink `#0B1220` for primary text
- Inter font, two weights (400/500) only
- Verified badge in sober green `#0F9D58`
- Card-based layouts, generous whitespace, mobile-first responsive
- Price is the typographic protagonist on every listing

**Why:** Aligns with the product's wedge ("real prices, verified sellers, one tap to chat"). Differentiates from existing Nigerian marketplaces (Jiji, Jumia) which use denser classified-ad aesthetics. Scales gracefully from cheap consumer goods to luxury items. Reads as "credible business" to first-time visitors.

**Locked elements:**
- Brand colors (teal + ink) — never change
- Typography family (Inter) — never change
- Verified badge color (#0F9D58) — never change

**Iterable elements:**
- Spacing scale, exact font sizes, card paddings — tunable as we learn from user feedback
- Specific imagery, page composition — tunable per phase

## D-021: Tailwind tokens vs inline values

**Decision:** All design values live in `tailwind.config.ts`. No inline hex codes, no magic spacing numbers in component markup. Components use Tailwind utility classes only.

**Why:** When (not if) we tune the design, we change one token file, not 200 component files. Phase A's "phantom column" lesson applies broadly: single source of truth saves debugging hours later.
